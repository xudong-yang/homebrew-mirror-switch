# switch-homebrew-mirror

A script switches homebrew mirror to [Tencent Cloud Mirrors](https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/). Taps and bottles are both suppored. 

Using Tencent Cloud mirrors incredibly speeds up the connection of homebrew in China. 


## How to use

Simply run `./run.sh` or `./run.sh official` to set your homebrew origin to the official ones. 

Run `./run.sh tencent` to use the Tencent Cloud mirros.
